Author: Norman Dunbar

Circuit: N/A

Purpose: Testing "digitalToggle()" from Listing_5.7. Flashed built in LED.

WARNING: digitalToggle() will of course be overwritten if and when you update the
         Arduino IDE. It really needs to be added as an enhancement request to the 
         Arduino GitHub page.
