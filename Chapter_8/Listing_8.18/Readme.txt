Title: Listing 8.18 - Counter - Door Counter Example

Purpose: Uses Timer/counter 1 as a counter. It will increment whenever there is a door opened
         which we demonstrate by using a switch here. The count of times the door has been opened 
         will be shown on the Serial Monitor.

         If you have a bouncy switch, you might see the count increasing more than the number
         of times you pressed it. If (like me) you appear to have the best and least bouncy
         switch in the world, be surprised! I know I was.

         I was expecting to see bounces counted, but my switch appears almost perfect. I had to
         simulate a bouncy switch by using a pair of wires!

         Don't touch the wires to the wrong place though, you can short out the ATmega328P.
